POWER BI FINAL PROJECT – COMPLETE SUMMARY

Project Overview:

This project is an end-to-end Power BI Sales & Returns Dashboard
developed from beginner level by following complete BI development steps
including data modeling, DAX calculations, dashboard design, mobile
optimization, and security implementation.

All required tasks were successfully completed and tested.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. DATA MODELING

-   Loaded all tables into Power BI Desktop.
-   Created relationships between Fact and Dimension tables.
-   Implemented proper Star Schema structure.
-   Ensured correct Primary & Foreign Key relationships.
-   Hidden unnecessary columns for clean report view.
-   Maintained consistent naming conventions.

Tables Used: - Sales_Fact - Returns_Fact - Date_Dim - Customer_Dim -
Product_Dim - Region_Dim

------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. DAX MEASURES & CALCULATIONS

Created all required measures including:

Basic Measures: - Total Sales - Total Profit - Total Quantity - Total
Returns

Time Intelligence: - Sales YTD - Sales YoY - Sales MoM

Advanced Logic: - KPI Classification using SWITCH - Top N Products by
Sales - Top N Customers by Profit - Profit Category Column - Customer
Full Name Column - Year-Month Formatting

While creating measures, some DAX errors occurred. Errors were carefully
analyzed by reading error messages, understanding syntax issues, and
correcting logic independently. All DAX measures are now working
correctly.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. DASHBOARD DESIGN

Main Dashboard includes: - KPI Cards - Line Chart (Sales Trend) - Bar
Chart (Sales by Region) - Donut Chart (Sales by Category) - Matrix with
Conditional Formatting - Top N Analysis

All visuals are properly formatted and interactive.

7. SECURITY (RLS - ROW LEVEL SECURITY)

-   Implemented Role-Level Security based on Region.
-   Created separate roles for different Managers.
-   Each manager can view only their respective regional data.
-   Tested security using “View As Role”.
-   Security working successfully.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

FINAL STATUS:

-   All tasks completed successfully.
-   All measures and visuals working properly.
-   Dashboard fully interactive.
-   Mobile layout configured.
-   Security implemented and tested.

This project demonstrates strong understanding of: Data Modeling, DAX,
Time Intelligence, Dashboard Design, Mobile Optimization, and Power BI
Security.
